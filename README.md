# Haskell Lenses

This repo contains the both the slides and exercise sheet for a talk I gave on Haskells lenses

## Build it

1. You need to clone using the `--recursive` switch
2. Go to either the `slides` or `exercise` folder
3. Just call `latexmk` on `talk.tex` or `main.tex`

If you don't want to build everything yourself, you can also download the slides [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LukasPietzschmann/haskell-lenses/build/slides/talk.pdf) or [here](https://github.com/LukasPietzschmann/haskell-lenses/blob/build/slides/talk.pdf) and the exercise sheet [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LukasPietzschmann/haskell-lenses/build/exercise/main.pdf) or [here](https://github.com/LukasPietzschmann/haskell-lenses/blob/build/exercise/main.pdf)
