# Haskell Lenses

This repo contains the slides for a presentation I gave on haskells lenses

## Build it

1. You need to clone using the `--recursive` switch
2. Just call `latexmk` on the `talk.tex` file

If you don't want to build the slides yourself, you can also download them [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LukasPietzschmann/haskell-lenses/build/talk.pdf) or [here](https://github.com/LukasPietzschmann/haskell-lenses/blob/build/talk.pdf).
